To Curb the fake proxies for attendance by students using speech recognition and verification.

Its a common practice by students to register a proxy attendance for their fellow mates. At place where there is biometric systems for attendance, this aint a big problem. The places that still follow methods of verbal attendance which involves a teacher shouting roll calls and students responding "present sir/mam" this can be a big problem, because its not possible everytime for the prof to look who is responding which ultimately results in proxy attendance. 

What we can do is come up with a speech recognition system which can immediately recognize the students voice and in case it is found to be fake with the original roll call, he/she can be marked absent.
